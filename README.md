# Ryan Le's Tailwind Portfolio

Another year, another revamp of my portfolio site!

As is tradition, I thought it became necessary to rebuild my portfolio once again after spending the last year learnings lots of new frameworks, technologies, techniques, and more!

## So what's new this time?

This time around, we're saying goodbye to component libraries and selling hello to utility-first CSS frameworks! Namely: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Along with that...
* Replaced [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) (I find Contentful easier to work with these days, sorry!)
* Played around with Next.js 13 and their fancy new [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)
* Finally made the jump from JavaScript to TypeScript (about time...)
* Building upon what I've made previously and improving my designs ever so slightly each time
* Next.js isn't wrestling against me this time and actually lets me host my images/documents
* Plugged the [Ryan Meetup](https://www.ryanmeetup.com)
