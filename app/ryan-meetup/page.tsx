          <p>
            In February 2023, Ryan Rose wanted to make friends in her Brooklyn neighborhood, so she hung up the original Ryan Meetup flyers. What she didn&apos;t know at the time was that she would be kickstarting a worldwide movement
            and creating a community of Ryans from all over. Now, we at Ryan Meetup are all united in our goal to eventually break the world record for the <NextLink href='https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-same-name-gathering-first-name' className={emphasis}>largest same name gathering</NextLink>, and we&apos;ll stop at nothing to get there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two years and 15+ events later, we&apos;ve built something incredibly special and are still moving full speed ahead in our pursuit of that world record. It also helps that these events are very fun to host and attend.
